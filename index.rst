Step-by-Step Guide to Activate TNT Drama on Any Device
-------------------------------------------------------

1. Get the TNT App from Your Device’s App Store
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, go to your device’s app store.  
Just search for “TNT” or “TNT Drama” — you’ll find the app there.

- If you’re using a Roku, open the Roku Channel Store.
- On a Fire TV, go to the Amazon Appstore.
- If you have an Apple TV, use the App Store.
- For Android TV, open the Google Play Store.
- And if you're on an Xbox, head to the Microsoft Store.

Once you find the app, click to download and install it.  
After it installs, open the app. You’ll see a code on your screen hang onto that! You’ll need it in the next step, where we activate it at TNTDrama.com/activate.

2. Get Your TNT Activation Code from the App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the TNT app is installed, go ahead and open it on your TV.

- The app will guide you with simple instructions on the screen — just follow along.
- After a moment, you’ll see an activation code appear. It’s usually about 7 digits long.

Keep that code on your screen — you’ll need it in the next step to activate TNT on your device.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- On your phone, tablet, or computer, open your internet browser (like Chrome, Safari, or Firefox).
- In the address bar at the top, type in: TNTDrama.com/activate and hit enter.
- You might be redirected to a page that says tbs.com/activate don’t worry, that’s totally fine! TNT and TBS use the same activation system, so it will still work for TNT.

Once you're on that page, you’ll be ready to enter the code from your TV screen.

4. Submit Your TNT Activation Code

That’s it! In a few seconds, the TNT app on your TV should refresh, and you’ll be all set to start watching your favorite shows and movies.

5. Enter Your TV Provider Details to Finish Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- After you enter the activation code, you’ll be asked to choose your cable or satellite provider from a list (like Xfinity, Spectrum, Dish, DIRECTV, etc.).
- Once you select your provider, you’ll need to log in using your TV account details — that’s your username and password you normally use for your cable or satellite service.
- After you log in, give it a moment — your TV screen will refresh, and the TNT app will be activated.

Now you're all set to enjoy your favorite TNT shows and movies!
